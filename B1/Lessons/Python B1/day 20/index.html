    <p>Photography</p>
    <p>Photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. It's a way to capture moments and transform them into lasting memories. Photography can be practiced by anyone, from amateurs to highly skilled professionals, and can be applied in various fields such as art, journalism, and science.</p>
